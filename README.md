# Notepad-Sharp
A notepad++ look-alike written in C#
# Build
Notepad# can be cloned into visual studio.
Once inside visual studio you will have to delete the references to the FastColoredTextBox and the tabstrip. You can then
add those references back by adding them from the project's resources folder.
# Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please do one of the following:

    1.) Build the latest release and test for bugs, please email Zachary.Pedigo1@gmail.com with details and log a new issue
      describing the reproduction steps and expected results.
    2.) Create a pull request and tag me as a reviewer. Although you DO have the freedom to commit directly to the master branch, I do
      ask that you please refrain. If anyone makes an unapproved commit to the master branch, I will manually revert the commit(s).
    3.) Provide feedback/tips and/or tricks. I am and will continue to be a student of software engineering, please contact me by my email
      listed above with any helpful advice you may have.
